React.memo
React.memo is a higher-order component provided by React that memoizes a functional component, 
optimizing its performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

When you wrap a functional component with React.memo, React will memoize the result of rendering that 
component based on its props. If the props have not changed since the last render, React will reuse the
 memoized result and skip the rendering process for that component, thus avoiding unnecessary re-renders.




STATE DOWN
Pushing state down, also known as "prop drilling," is a term used in React to describe the process of 
passing state from a parent component to its nested child components through props.
