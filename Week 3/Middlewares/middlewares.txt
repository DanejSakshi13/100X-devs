express - routing and middleware web framework
express application - series of middleware functions calls

middleware functions - functions that have access to request and response object

middleware functions (tasks) - 
-execute any code
-make changes to req and res cycle
-end the req-res cycle
-call the next middleware function in stack

[re-use middlewares]
eg- ticket counter for an amusement park
one ticket counter for all rides vs separate ticket counter for separate rides
