State in React
-The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. 
-A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.
-The state object is where you store property values that belong to the component.

Global State
-React global state refers to the data or state that all components in a React application share. 
-This data is typically stored in a global object, such as a state manager like Redux or the React 
context API, and it can be accessed by any component in the application that needs it.
